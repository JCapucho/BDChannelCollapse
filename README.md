# Better discord channel collapse
Better discord plugin that provides a keybinding `ctrl+b` and a button to collapse the channel sidebar

Heavily inspired by [discord-channel-collapse-button](https://github.com/notmike101/discord-channel-collapse-button)

## Installation
Copy the `plugin.js` file to the plugins folder

## TODO
Make the keybinding customizable
